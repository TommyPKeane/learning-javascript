## Setup

- `nvm install` will make sure that the correct version of Node.js is available
- `direnv allow` will establish a local environment using the correct version of Node.js

You can confirm that the above worked by comparing the output of these two commands:

- `node --version`
- `cat ./.nvmrc`

## Running the Code

All examples can be run by passing the path to the JavaScript module (the `.js` file) to the `node` executable after you've done the setup documented above.

For example, this shows running one of the examples and what it's output will be:

```bash
‚ùØ node ./...
```
