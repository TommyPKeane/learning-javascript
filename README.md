# Learning JavaScript (TypeScript)

Tommy teaches Tommy (and anyone who wants to actually read this) how to code in JavaScript and TypeScript (also referred to as ECMAScript).

I've been doing various amounts of JavaScript coding since 2004-ish in personal, professional, and academic projects, but you're never too old to learn, and they keep making computers better and worse all the time. Humility is definitely needed if you're gonna be working with JavaScript, so don't get too attached to the ways that you think things should work.
