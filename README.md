# Learning JavaScript (TypeScript)

__tommy teaches tommy__ (and anyone who wants to actually read this) how to code in JavaScript (ECMAScript) and TypeScript for client-side or server-side applications based-on a JavaScript interpreter (runtime).

I've been doing various amounts of JavaScript coding since 2004-ish in personal, professional, and academic projects, but you're never too old to learn, and they keep making computers better and worse all the time. Humility is definitely needed if you're gonna be working with JavaScript, so don't get too attached to the ways that you think things should work.

## Setup

See the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for the overall setup design and details about this repository, or how to make sure your system is setup with any prerequisites.

Also note that each self-contained directory will also have a top-level `README.md` file which should explain exactly how to use or run the code contained within.

## What is JavaScript (ECMAScript)?

These directories under the `javascript` folder contain different examples of pure JavaScript (ECMAScript) syntax, which can all be run with Node.js, per the local configuration through `nvm` and `direnv`.

<a id="what-is-typescript"></a>
## What is TypeScript?

These directories under the `typescript` folder contain different examples of TypeScript syntax, which can all be run with Node.js after being transpiled from TypeScript to JavaScript through the documented process in each README.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

_"What's in a name?"_

You can see a rambly explanation [here at my personal website](https://tommypkeane.com/about-tommy/tommy-teaches-tommy.html); but, in short:

I'm just trying to say that I'm writing out what I think is helpful/interesting to me, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to anyone else, but please know that I'm ___not___ trying to talk _down_ to anyone :smile: (except maybe myself :ghost:).
